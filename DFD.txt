DFD (Data Flow Diagram)
-----------------------
* A DFD shows the flow of data through the system and is also used for modelling the requirements.
* Also known as Bubble Chart or Data flow graph.

Symbols used in DFD:
Circle				Process			Depicts a process that transforms data inputs into data outputs.
Arrow				Data Flow		Shows flow of data into or out of a process or data store
Rectangle			Source/Sink		An external entity that acts as a source of System Input or sink of system outputs.
Parallel lines 		Data Store		Data Repository: a collection of data items.

Important Points:
- Unique names are important.
- DFDs depict flow of data and not order of events like a flowchart.
- Decision Paths (diamond nodes) represent logical expressions are not specified.

Levelling in a DFD:
- DFDs can be drawn to represent the system at different levels of abstraction.
- Higher level(initial level e.g. level0 or level1) DFDs are partitioned/refined into lower level(having more information and functional details.)

Level-0 DFD: Context Diagram or Fundamental System Model
- Represents the entire system as a single bubble with input and output data indicated by incoming and outgoing arrows.
- Decompose this DFD into multiple bubbles.
- Each bubble is then decomposed into more detailed DFDs.

N.B:- Preserve the number of inputs and outputs between different levels of DFD
