SRS (Software Requirement Specification)
----------------------------------------
* A requirements specification in a software system is a complete description of the behavior of a system to be developed.
* It includes set of use cases that describes all interactions the users will have with the software.

Consist of:
> functional requirements
	- describe functionality or system services.
	- depends on type of software, expected users.
	
> Non-functional requirements
	- these define system properties and constraints
		e.g. reliablility, response time and storage requirements.
	- more important than functional.
	
SRS Document should have:
> Introduction
	- Purpose
	- Scope
	- Definition
	- System Overview
	- References

> Overall Description
	- Product perspective
	- Product Functions
	- User Characteristics
	- Constraints, Assumptions and Dependencies.
	
> Specific Requirements
	- External Interfaces
	- Functions
	- Performance Requirements
	- Logical DB Requirements
	- Design Constraints
	- Key Features
	
> Validation Checks
	- Validity Check
	- Consistency Check
	- Realism Check
	- Verifiablility Check
	- Completeness Check
